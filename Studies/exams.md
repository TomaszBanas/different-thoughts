## Why do we still force peaple to memorize books?

I am just learning to pass my exams, I am studing IT on AGH in Krakow Poland. This semester is first one that I thought could be interesting just beacause I have few subjects that can be very very very usefull in the future and also very interesting.  

Those subjects are Programing Infrastucture and Computer Networks. Both are subjects that have some much to offer and so much to lern from. But after first lecture in witch in both cases I was rather scroll throw tinder or drow some ugly scribbles. I have watched many hours of similar content on YT I was many conversations with many peoples on both of those subjects but still I do not understood a word that those lecturers said. You would say that is beacuse I already knows everything. And the answear is **NO**. And why do I know that it because of even more ridicules thing the **Exams** witch I do not pass in my first attempt. The question on exam where so misleading and specific that probably even creators of technologi Do not remember.

I am working as a Programmer for 4 years know. And every year I know how much knowalge is still there for me to learn. I thought that studies could give me a motifation to learn, the direction where I could receve information in frienly way. And I was so wrong.

I do not say that every thing at university is worng. I have many laboratories where I have some task to accomplish and I could use both internet and and profesor for some advice. I learn something but not as much I hoped for. 

And at the end of the semester my filings where scrawled with mud. When for three days I had to memorize almost 50 pages of information that **everyone** will forget the next day.

My country has one of the worst eniversities in whole world but it is free. But maybe it shouldn't be.

I hope some day it will bet better.
